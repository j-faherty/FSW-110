        <h2 id="H2-1">Introduction</h2>
        <p class="para">Hello, my name is Jorden. I am studying web development and this is my first web page. I'd like to tell you a little bit about myself.</p>
        <h2 id="H2-2">Background</h2>
        <p class="para">I have worked with kids with Autism for about 7 years but decided on a career change to support my family. It was also getting very stressful to work with kids at work and come home to my two kids.</p>
        <h2 id="H2-3">Goals</h2>
        <h3 id="H3-1">Career Goals</h3>
        <p class="para">My hope is to become a Full Stack Web Developer and to be able to secure a job in Germany. Because jobs in IT are in such high demand everywhere, especially in Germany, I'm hoping this will be a solid career to move into and be able to take care of my family financially. Most ideally, I would like to be working remotely so I can be with my family right away before and after work.</p>
        <h3 id="H3-2">Why Germany?</h3>
        <p class="para">When I was in high school, my family hosted a foreign exchange student from Germany and I fell in love with the culture and language. I visited Germany a couple times after she went back home and it was always a dream to move there.</p>
